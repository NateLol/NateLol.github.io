            </div>After few hours of template searching, I have found myself this particular template that I love. So, it&rsquo;s official now! I have a new blog running.
As the first post here, I would like to record the process of creating and deploying this blog so people who wants to do the same can have some reference. Hope this post can be helpful!
Prerequisites This blog is built with Hugo and one of the popular themes LoveIt.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
