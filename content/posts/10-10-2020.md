After few hours of template searching, I have found myself this particular template that I love. So, it's official now! I have a new blog running.



As the first post here, I would like to record the process of creating and deploying this blog so people who wants to do the same can have some reference. Hope this post can be helpful!



## Prerequisites

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gogugo.io) and one of the popular themes [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt). To deploy your blog on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you need to register [here](https://github.com) if you don't already have an account.

## Installation and Deployment



### Step 1: Install Hugo

I build and code on Macbook with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), so this insturction will be for MacOS only.

```bash
# install the latest version of hugo
brew install hugo

# to verify your new install
hugo version
```

### Step 2: Create a New Site

This will create a new Hugo site in a folder named `blog`.

```bash
hugo new site blog
```

### Step 3: Add a Theme

In this blog, we use [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) as the theme .

```bash
cd blog
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt themes/loveit

# to set loveit as the default theme
echo 'theme = loveit' >> config.toml
```

### Step 4: Set up Souce Code Repo

Create on github a empty new project `blog`  to keep track of the source code.

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your name>/project.git
```

### Step 5: Build and Preview Site

Before we continue to deploy on Github Pages, we first preview the site by

```bash
hugo serve
```

then navigate to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to check if the site is working properly. If so, hit `ctrl+c` to stop and remove `public ` folder by

```bash
rm -rf public
```

### Step 6: Set up Github Page Repo

As a next step, we need first to create on github a page repo named `<yourname>.github.io` and add it as a submodule.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/<yourname>/<yourname>.github.io.git public
```

### Step 7: Deploy!

You are right about to finish by simply run following:

```bash
# build site
hugo
# push source code for version control
git push origin main

cd public
git add.
git commit -m "Any commits you want"
# push to github page
git push origin main

```

### Step 8: Yay!

You are all set and you can visit your blog at `https://<yourname>.github.io`.
