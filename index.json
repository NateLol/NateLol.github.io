[{"categories":["Misc"],"content":"I came to find out that I can no longer listen to QQ music since I moved here to Singapore. That is definitely something I need to take care of since we all need some of the medoly to boost our work. After a quick seach, I have found this perticular approach that can help with that. What’s more, new Apple music subscriber would have a long period of 3 months free service. Yay!! After that period, if you are a mainlander university student, you can enjoy the service with only 5 CNY. With all that being said, let’s get started on the transfer. The steps are not the complicated and it only takes few minutes to finish that compared with the time-consuming and repeatitive copy from QQ music and pasting in Apple. As a first step, click this link here to open up a new blank tab. Next, right click on the blank tab and select Inspect from the poppped-up window. Then find Console on the table and paste following code there, do not hit Enter just yet, (function () { var script = document.createElement(\"SCRIPT\"); script.src = 'https://apps.bdimg.com/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js'; script.type = 'text/javascript'; document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script); var checkReady = function (callback) { if (window.jQuery) { callback(jQuery); } else { window.setTimeout(function () { checkReady(callback); }, 100); } }; checkReady(function ($) { var text=\"\"; $.ajax({ url: \"https://c.y.qq.com/v8/fcg-bin/fcg_v8_playlist_cp.fcg?id= [Please place with your playlist ID] \u0026cv=60102\u0026ct=19\u0026newsong=1\u0026tpl=wk\u0026g_tk=5381\u0026loginUin=0\u0026hostUin=0\u0026format=json\u0026inCharset=GB2312\u0026outCharset=utf-8\u0026notice=0\u0026platform=jqspaframe.json\u0026needNewCode=0\", async:false, dataType:\"json\", success:function(data){ var songlist = data.data.cdlist[0].songlist; for(var i=0;i \u003c songlist.length; i++){ var tmp = songlist[i]; text += tmp.singer[0].name +\" - \"+ tmp.name+\"\u003cbr\u003e\"; } } }); $('body').empty(); $('body').append(\"\u003cdiv\u003e\"+text+\"\u003c/div\u003e\"); }); })(); Navigate your web QQ music to the desired playlist page that you would like to transfer to Apple. Find the play list ID from the url like, https://y.qq.com/n/yqq/playlist/ [your play list here] .html#stat=y_new.profile.create_playlist.love.click\u0026dirid=201 Plug the playlist ID to the console and press Enter, then the blank page with be filled with a list full of songs parsed from your playlist. Full copy the text on the page and go to this tunemymusic website and hit Let's start , choose the source as from text, paste in text, choose target as Apple Music (you might need to log in). And, you are done! Open Apple Music and enjoy!
